Could you elaborate?--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 11:52, 25 March

Because I sent my 3DS to Nintendo ,I found unknown title game "????????"
played.


The ???????? is used by Nintendo to mask the application's identity from
the 3DS. The same thing happens when I use some Dev apps on my dev unit.
It has a 'Question Mark' icon with "????????" as its name when I look in
Activity Log. --[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 23:52, 29 March 2012

You should move this page to "Nintendo 3DS Servicing Tools" or something
like that, because "????????" can be any application Nintendo wants to
hide from a 3DS' history. --[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 23:56, 29

It seems Nintendo used them to check.

Can you take photos?--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 22:25, 25 March
