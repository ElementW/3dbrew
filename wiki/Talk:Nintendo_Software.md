## Replace with Category:Nintendo Software?

I think a category is more proper for this kind of subject, so I
categorised the linked articles in [Category:Nintendo
Software](:Category:Nintendo_Software "wikilink"). Maybe that category
should replace the whole article (i.e. remove the article, link to the
category instead)? [FireFly](User:FireFly "wikilink") 17:15, 31 March

## App Screenshots

I have screenshots of Activity Log, Download Play, Health and Safety,
Mii Maker, Nintendo 3DS Camera, Nintendo 3DS Sound and StreetPass Mii
Plaza. Should I upload them to their pages here on
3DBrew.org?--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 06:17, 28 April 2012
