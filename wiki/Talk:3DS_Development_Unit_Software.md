If hardwares are same as ordinary 3DSã€€perfectly and then we dump ram
,copy it to our 3DS,

we can use mine as development version. --Matyapiro31 14:24, 18 October

Dump the RAM? First we have to find out the pinout of it, then we can go
ahead!--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 17:59, 18 October

Sorry,3DS Flash,not RAM. --Matyapiro31 18:15, 18 October 2011 (CEST)


Ah, OK! Is the flash chip actually encrypted with a console unique key?
If not, this could be a
plan!--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 18:42, 18 October

Neimod, can you tell me the differences between a Test unit and a
Development unit?(considering i don't actually have a development
unit).--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 17:23, 19 October 2011 (CEST)


This is the development "unit":

The unit you possess is given to testers.

Thanks for clearing this up, [Neimod](User:Neimod "wikilink"), from now
on we will call [3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink")'s special 3DS "test
unit". I think we should focus a bit on getting the system unique key(s)
now. I propose that we do a RAM dump, because it's possible that the 3DS
(when starting up) pushes the key to RAM. Also we can get some
information about the 3DS memory map. However, we don't know the pinout
of the RAM, that's the
problem...--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 20:52, 19

Can you guess which font is used for the test unit?

Do you like to find the ID
of[Nintendo_Technical_Support](https://ntsc.nintendo.co.jp/)?
