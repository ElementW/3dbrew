# Service Command Notation

There seems to be some disagreement on how to notate commands on
services. Some people do this: AMNet:OpenTicket (as done by the wiki for
page naming), others do am:net::OpenTicket.

I'd like to propose that the wiki page naming continues with
all-uppercase service names followed by initial uppercase port name
(i.e., am:net -\> AMNet, act:u -\> ACTU, and so on), but that they are
used in text to be more precise: am:net#OpenTicket,
act:u#GetAccountDataBlock. This is loosely modeled after Ruby and
Javadoc method notation. [Infinicore](User:Infinicore "wikilink")
