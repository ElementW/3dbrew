Hello, i'm Antoine, my Nintendo 3DS Friend Code is 0989 - 1719 - 3479 if
you add me, please post back your code on the discussion page !

I did some preliminary research on [StreetPass](StreetPass "wikilink").

I have an European Nintendo 3DS, and an Acekard 2i

In the past I worked on several projects in the Nintendo DS Scene :

- My first homebrew ToiletDS
- French translation of DSOrganize
- Custom Homebrew DataBase Server for DSOrganize
- French translation for BeUp (MSN Messenger Client)

I'm also contributing a lot to both Songbird and Mozilla projects
