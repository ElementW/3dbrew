I have a whole backup of all the o3ds titles on the CDN up to and
including system version 10.3, as reported by yls8.mtheall.com. See this
page for the titles I'm missing: <http://txti.es/savecdn> I haven't had
much time to clean up/finish it, though (some titles have been extracted
wrongly using ctrtool without the -p option, and have to be tracked
down, for example). If someone fancies finishing it, or just needs
select titles from it. drop me a line on freenode (mid-kid). -- mid-kid
