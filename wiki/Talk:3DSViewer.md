Nice program but, I don't see any reason to use your tool, because
neimod already released his ctrtool, which can do more than your tool.
Why should we use your
tool?--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 19:02, 4 September

This tool should be developed to have all the ctrtool's abilities and
more..That's why the source is released. The benefit we get is the C#
security algorithms so we don't need aes.h and such.. and it lays out
the information in GUI so it's easier for the hacker to spot the
important stuff. I want to emphasize that I'm not a hacker and I don't
really know what's important and whats not... Anyway I will continue to
develop this utility to have all the functions the ctrtool has...
