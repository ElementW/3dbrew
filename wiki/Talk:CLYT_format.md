## Unable to edit the wiki page

I tried to edit this page again on the 27th of february, then on the
28th of february, then again on march 1st and then again today march 2nd
and I've been unable to, being prompted with
`*** Forbidden. Message seems to be spam. ***` every time I tried to
save changes, I tried making minor changes too to see if somehow one of
my changes was detected as spam but it all ends with the same error, I
don't understand what could have made this happen but it's very
unfortunate, if I can't manage to edit the page with this account I'll
have to create a new one. I don't know if the website admins will see it
or not but I hope that whatever was wrong with my account or with the
page gets fixed, thanks for your time.
