I maybe wrong here...but I think I made a mistake and ARC files are just
LZ-10 compressed files and the 'darc' header belongs to the BCMA manual
files.. I will update as soon as I'll find out...If this is true then
the files in the darc format are not compressed.

DARC with LZ-11 compression is used for a number of other things besides
the instruction manuals, like [ExeFS](ExeFS "wikilink"):/.logo.

The problem with that the I "opened" the bcma file 3dsguy uploaded
(which is a DARC file) and inside it there were 4 'arc' files which were
4 'darc' files compressed with LZ-10. After that I decompressed them and
"opened" them and there were no more compressed files in them. So I must
agree that DARC files are just containers and have nothing to do with
compression (although it is used often as such).
