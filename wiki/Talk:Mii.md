heya, i noticed that there wasn't a section to tell you which eyes were
where at the bottom of the page. all other facial features have it, but
not eyes. i do know that the default eyes (page1 row1 col1) is 0x1A,
though. if someone has it written down anywhere, please upload it to
this page. thanks --[HEYimHeroic](User:HEYimHeroic "wikilink") 23:52, 25

welp, since no one else did it, i went ahead and documented the eyes.
i'm adding it to the page right now.
