This doesn't work in DS mode on a 3DS, correct?

- This only works on a DS/DSLite, no workaround or fix is possible for
  3DS/DSi! [crediar](User:Crediar "wikilink") 12:28, 17 April 2011

Can you make the sources available for DSaveManager? I'd just like to
see the flash code and see what I can do with it. If possible.

## 3DS save file names

Hello and thanks a lot for this very usefull tool. But can you implement
that the software made the save files named like the 3DS-game code that
displayed in the screen of the DS before i begin to backup the 3DS-save
file. Why can i only restore files named .sav but the backup create
files named .bin? I hope this is not impossible to implement into the
Software.

Friendly greetings and best wishes for the new year! :-)
