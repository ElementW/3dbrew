## Save File exploits of cartridger games

do they really need a previously hacked system to be installed, I mean
wouldnt it be possible that one person could make the exploit, backup
the savegame via Powersaves or whatever and then others could reimport
that?

Depends on the save crypto. Newer games have to have it done via
exploits.
