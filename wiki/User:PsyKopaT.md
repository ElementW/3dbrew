Hi, I am the maker of DSRO, and was wondering if you could help me. I am
looking for the file header structure for the 3DS files. I saw that you
have your own program, and was wondering if you could share me the file
header structure, since the NDS one doesn't work for it.

Thank you in advance


Please don't say 3DS files, they're [CCIs](CCI "wikilink").

Actually we don't need another tool for parsing ROM dumps, we have
enough IMO.--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 19:37, 6

I am not making a dumper. check my site www.dsromorganizer.com

it's for adding the roms to your own List for managing. All I need it so
I can pull the basic info from the rom, to compare with the list. I did
find <http://3dbrew.org/wiki/CXI> which has the info I need, but not
sure If I can call it from the beginning of the file, or if the CCI is
upfront. Kinda puzzled with the whole structure
