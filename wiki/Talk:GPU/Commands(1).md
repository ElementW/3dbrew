Hey,yellows8,What is the purpose of analyzing GPU Commands?

You should find AES keys first? If you find it,other tasks will solved
easily.--Matyapiro31 15:35, 3 March 2013 (CET)


"What is the purpose of analyzing GPU Commands?" For properly rendering
graphics instead of directly writing to the LCD framebuffers of course.
"You should find AES keys first?" There's not really any
[AES](AES "wikilink") normal-keys to find since that's done in hardware
where the final normal-key is generated by the hardware. "If you find
it,other tasks will solved easily" No, using the AES engine does not
make other tasks such as GPU commands RE "easy" at all.
