Hey there. I'm CHR15x94. You probably haven't heard of me, and that's
because I haven't really made or done anything useful to contribute to
the hacking/homebrew community before. The only semi interesting thing
I've made is a half-ass GameBoy (monochrome) emulator, which can be
found on EmuTalk (build's old though). I'll create and edit pages here
on 3DBrew when I can.

## Contact Info

I'm registered on other sites as well, but these are the ones I am most
frequently on.
