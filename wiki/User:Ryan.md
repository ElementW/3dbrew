I am Ryan, a self-made contributor to the Nintendo 3DS hacking scene. I
am here to document whatever new things I find relating to the Nintendo
3DS hardware, software, dev units, hacking, and homebrew. I will make
sure to verify my findings and I would be happy to speak to anyone who
can help me ^w^

Add me if you'd like, my friend code is 4339-2934-6203.
