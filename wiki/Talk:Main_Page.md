Sorry, this is not the correct page to talk about that. However, it's a
good topic for our new forum! <http://n-dev.net/index.php>

-Hello, I would like to translate this great wiki into French, how
should I do ? Thanks :)


I guess each page you want to translate you need to edit the page's link
with a '/' (slash) after it and the language code (fr for french i
think), for instance edit the page
<http://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page/Fr> and then put a link on the
bottom next to Japanese.. --[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink")

You should take a look
[here](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Template:Languages)...Apperantly we
don't have the needed template for it to work automaticaly maybe we need
the admin to install some kind of extension to support this type of
thing. --[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink") 18:59, 21 December 2011

-Yes, it would be more practical. For now, I'll continue translating
like that, please tell me when the plugin is added. ---I added a
language selection bar at the bottom of each main page.

## SVG upload

Hey neimod, can you enable svg uploading? I want to upload graphics for

stuff)--[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink") 14:41, 9 February 2012

## Does anyone know how to tell an installed/braindumped title's version?

I'm on 9.3 and have hax. I want to know this so I can contribute
versions to to the title list. --[Hiccup](User:Hiccup "wikilink")
([talk](User_talk:Hiccup "wikilink")) 14:57, 6 January 2016 (CET)


1.If you have NAND Xorpad you can dump and decrypt to get the
.[TMD](TMD "wikilink") files and read the version from it. 2.Use
[AM](AM "wikilink") service, and use "AM_ListTitles" from libctru,
structure "AM_TitleEntry" includes the version. 3.Most versions of
System Titles are fetched via System Update SOAP response, thanks to
[Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") for that.

BTW I suggest you to ask questions on 4dsdev.org or
IRC(EFNET.org#3dsdev) thus it may be dealt faster.

## question

Can we get an actual board to discuss things instead of a shitty wiki
that's setup like this? --[NintendoFan](User:NintendoFan "wikilink")
([talk](User_talk:NintendoFan "wikilink")) 09:36, 3 May 2016 (CEST)


It says so in the previous discussion on this page :P \[4dsdev.org\]

4dsdev looks quite dead with a sticky about merging that is 5 months
old. :P GBAtemp
[1](http://gbatemp.net/categories/nintendo-3ds-discussions.198/) is
quite active, why not there? --[MKody](User:MKody "wikilink")
([talk](User_talk:MKody "wikilink")) 10:40, 3 May 2016 (CEST)

Eh, while GBATemp is a good place I'd much rather have a board that's
specifically dedicated to 3DS modding, not just modding in general.
Also, I'd much rather start fresh with a new board than trying to revive
a dead community that's been merged into some other board.

## Uploads are broken

MediaWiki throws a MWException whenever I try to upload an image file.
Perhaps uploads are not configured properly?

## Seedminer?

There should be some documentation about seedminer on this wiki.
