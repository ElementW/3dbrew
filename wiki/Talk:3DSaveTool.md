I uploaded a "SaveTool" type web service here:

Instructions in the same place.

3DSaveTool worked well for me on Windows 7 but then crashed no matter
what I did with it on a WinXP-SP3/netbook. The web service is an easily
accessible alternative that works whatever your OS, as long as you can
upload/download binaries to it.

It puts the 512 byte key at the end of the file and removes it when you
re-encrypt, instead of separating it into a second file.
