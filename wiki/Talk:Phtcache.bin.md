Yes, I know. This page is a mess. I just thought throwing this out there
would be helpful to somebody. Right now I'm trying to figure out if I
can get the 3DS camera program to take a file it didn't create.

Yes, the 3DS camera program will take a file it didn't create. It just
has to follow similar naming conventions as the files the 3DS camera
writes (though the letters and numbers can be different).

I've seen this page, although very useful, was not updated when I wanted
to create a utility for changing the phtcache.bin. So soon I will update
this if I see past oversights or errors. It seems that the layout file
phtcache.bin have changed since the last update of this page. Blocks of
information on image / video are now 152 bytes and not 98. Sorry for my
bad English. [Safirion](User:Safirion "wikilink") 15:39, 21 March 2013
