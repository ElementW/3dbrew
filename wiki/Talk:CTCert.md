@yellows8, Is the signature size 0x3C or 0x40? You wrote 0x40 on the
signature template, but 0x3C on this
page.--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 04:31, 26 April 2013 (CEST)


"wrote 0x40 on the signature template" Fixed, that was mainly copy-paste
from the size you used. --[Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") 04:43, 26

lol, I copied that size from
[wiibrew.org](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Certificate_chain). BTW, are any
of RSA SHA-1 signatures used with the
3DS?--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 05:29, 26 April 2013 (CEST)


Nope, SHA1 with RSA is not used with 3DS TMDs/tickets.
