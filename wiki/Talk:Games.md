Looks like Nintendo will let us download the game from eshop, could we
decrypt this?

No AES keys are known. Retail and eShop games are identical besides
additional encryption for the latter and exheader stuff.

### Rom sizes

@3dsguy, different regions has different rom sizes...maybe it's
useless.. we just need the save flash size...can be obtained from the
flash id (last byte) --[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink") 17:03, 20

Well if you think it's a hindrance, revert
it.--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 01:46, 21 June 2012 (CEST)

## What is this for?

And should the revision and title id low be recorded? Or is the title id
low in the serial? --[Hiccup](User:Hiccup "wikilink") 18:36, 21 November
