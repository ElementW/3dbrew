The links in the japanese eshop pages reveal its
serials...--[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink") 12:52, 27 February

Yes, but it is a release version serial, while title id is different.

The samurai description seems wrong. It says shop ID 2 and 3 are for Wii
U but I'm getting even Nintendo switch games from there, example: https
//samurai.wup.shop.nintendo.net/samurai/ws/DE/contents/?shop_id=2&freeword=mansion%203 -
Also the very first title here is a 3DS game: https
//samurai.wup.shop.nintendo.net/samurai/ws/DE/contents/?shop_id=2 - So
how to get Wii U titles only? \~~ --[V10lator](User:V10lator "wikilink")

I can't add anything to this page. I get this: "\*\*\* Forbidden.
Contains contacts. Message seems to be spam. \*\*\*" Could someone fix
this please? --[Xylophoneclarinet](User:Xylophoneclarinet "wikilink")

I can't edit the page either. Please document samurai's platform\[\]
parameter. Thanks in advance.
