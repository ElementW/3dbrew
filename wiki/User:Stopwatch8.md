Hello! My name is Tyler, but my internet alias is Stopwatch8. Not really
sure why I chose that name. Something to do with Runescape. Anyway, I am
18 years old, and my favorite title is Ocarina of Time 3d. I still
believe, to this day, that it remains one of the best games ever
created. I am a pretty big gamer, and the Xbox 360 is my main console.
Obviously, the 3DS is my preferred handheld. I have added everyone with
a friend code, so I would be happy if you add me! Just check the Friend
Code section for my FC.
