In China, I found a lot of blue screen 3DS these days. One is like the
picture below, is this some kind of software problem or hardware
problem? ![<File:N3DS> down?.jpg](N3DS_down?.jpg "File:N3DS down?.jpg")

If the 3DS doesn't look physically damaged, I'd say it's a software
problem. Most likely the NAND is
corrupt.--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 12:23, 2 May 2012 (CEST)
