behind the scenes communicate with certain services. Services in this
sense are system processes running in the background which wait for
incoming requests. When a process wants to communicate with a service,
it first needs to get a handle to the named service, and then it can
communicate with the service via interprocess communication. Each
service has a name up to 8 characters, for example "nim:u".
