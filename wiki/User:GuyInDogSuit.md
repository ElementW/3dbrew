I got my 3DS in December 2012, primarily to play KH: 3D, RE: Rev and
Castlevania: LoS-MoF. I also own a Wii and a DSi XL. I own a total of 10
3DS games:

Art Academy: Lessons for Everyone Castlevania: Lords of Shadow- Mirror
of Fate Kid Icarus (3D Classics) Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance
Metroid II: Return of Samus (VC) New Super Mario Bros. 2 Street Fighter
IV 3D Super Mario 3D Land Resident Evil: Revelations Tales of the Abyss

I have yet to actually play anything online with anyone, but if any one
is up for it, let me know!
