After the latest update, the useragent is Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U;
; fr) Version/1.7455.EU. Looks like Nintendo also updates the browser.

According to the changelog files, their code would be more than 2 years
old. Though, the WebCore/SharedScript folder has a timestamp that says
05/27/2011. Also, their versioning scheme doesn't match Webkit revisions
or anything else, ~~perhaps they just made up random version numbers~~
it is a Netfront version number... anyway I'm still seeking for a way to
identify the Webkit version used here. I'll let you know if I find out.
It is most likely between revisions 52463 and 53319, between Webkit
versions 532.7.1 and 532.8 (matching WebkitGTK 1.1.18).
