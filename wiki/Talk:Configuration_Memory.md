"This contains the titleID of the currently running menu launched by
[NS](NS "wikilink"). Normally this is the home menu TID, but if
launching that fails this titleID is the
[alternate](Title_list#00040030 "wikilink") menu.(On dev units this is
the dev menu TID)" When you say "dev menu" do you mean "[Dev
Menu](3DS_Development_Unit_Software#Dev_Menu "wikilink")"?


Yes, that's what I'm referring to of course.
