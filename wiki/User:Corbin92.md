I'm Corbin. Most people probably know me by the username of
corbin92/corbinr92 on most sites and Zeldafan20081 on GBATemp. I'm a
college student. I do minor things, like taking the bullet of updating
my broken O3DS to 10.0.0.27U to see if IronHax(et all) were still
working on it so that people wouldn't be so panicky about updating and
losing access to homebrew.
