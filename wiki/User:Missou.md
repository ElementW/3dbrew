'''''Hi! I'm Melissa...you can Call me MISSOU. I'm 16, and I'm
Algerian...I like playing Spirit Camera on 3DS, and Guitar Hero on DS
LITE...I'd like to play other games but some options on the 3DS are not
available in my country... It's not fair!!!! ='(

**''I got my 3DS as a gift from my cousin she's frensh....but I can't
have any game....**'''I'm a student in high school. I'm a pianist but I
prefer to spend my time on the web, and chatting with friends

***There are not many people who own a 3DS here so I would like to meet
other users around the world!***
