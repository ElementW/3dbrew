## Can't add friend code

Why can't I add my friend code? It won't let me save it for some reason.
It says "Forbidden. Contains contacts." How are people getting around
this? (Maybe someone can add my friend code for me? It is
1307\*1945\*5025 (replace the stars with dashes). Thanks!) EDIT: That
freind code no longer works, cuz my 3DS is broken, so nevermind about
adding it. Thanks! [SKCro](User:SKCro "wikilink")
