# Used 3DS?

You guys aren't planning on using a new 3DS are you? You could save a
few bucks by using a broken unit to donate to science.


Jl12 has a used 3DS for just this purpose.

## PayPal

Would it be possible to add a paypal option? I think it will make more
people donate since most aren't comfortable using their credit card
directly. I myself would give \$100.

Also the donation link on the fundraiser site should be a button so
people easier can find it.

## Paypal 2

I would also donate if you had paypal instead of skrill (but not 100\$,
maybie 10 or 15).
