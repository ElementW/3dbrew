I wondered if it was wrong,too.But TMD size is sometimes diffrent.

Are there any known access
rights?--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 17:42, 15

As said there is 0x00010005 representing the ECDSA. However I haven't
even encountered any TMD that using this type of signature. Even I've
found two DER format certificates in Process9 NCCH/CXI which is
contained in FIRM ARM9 section, and the two certs uses "id-ecPublicKey".
May be not important at all, but i wonder if that is really
used.--[Syphurith](User:Syphurith "wikilink")
