## 3dslink location

I just installed the development environment for the first time, on OSX
10.14.4. The 3dslink binary listed under "running your code" doesn't
seem to be in the same place for me, though. Could it be an outdated
location, or could it be different on OSX? In my case it's located in
`/opt/devkitpro/tools/bin/3dslink` after following these instructions.
Should the section be updated? [Dada78641](User:Dada78641 "wikilink")
